# DBMS_project(On-Shop)
This is a simple Data Base Management Project Based on E-Commerce Shopping Website.

To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.

Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the on-shop.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
Upload all files on your server except for on-shop.sql.
The admin user which I have made has an email id admin@admin.com and the password is admin. (Please confirm this in database or create one manually).
I have also added a dummy user for testing having an email id user@user.com and the password is user, just to make out the diffeence between an admin and a user.

Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database. Now re-upload this file to the server.
Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.
Enjoy!

Currently in Admin Panel only item quantity can be modified, more feature are yet to be developed/implemented.
